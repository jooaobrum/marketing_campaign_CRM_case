    "Since the business case is composed by 3 parts, I will split the problem in 3 different notebooks to be well organized and structured. The goal of the data analysis notebook will be analyze the provided dataset and understand the data. Also,  it is necessary to create some hypothesis, validate it using exploratory data analysis and extract some actionable insights. The second part is using some methods to create cluster of clients according to the profile and use it to create some recommendations for the marketing campaign. It should increase the profit, since we are aiming specific clients. The last part will be the predictive model, joining the results generated by the clustering modelization, we can predict if the client will accept the next offer and then calculate the business impact based on the inputs of the dataset.\n",
